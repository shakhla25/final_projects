Using Monte Carlo to analyze the change in Business revenue of an organization by increasing the click through rate of the organizations website.

Business organizations constantly strive to increase their web presence by employing different strategies such as the search engine  optimization, content marketing, social media enhancements etc. one of the the most used practices is increasing the click through rates.

My problem statement is to determine if there occurs an actual increase in revenue by investing a certain capital to improve the click through rate of a website.

Hypothesis:

Increasing the click through rate of one webpage increases the traffic to the website hence increases the profits.


Data:
Data is matrix that represents the business of a website. 
The site has a landing home page, a Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) page, a product page (where it lists the for sale products), and then pages for the two products the business offers. Each product can only be purchased from the product page.
Each row lists the connection probability between pages.

2	A client is assumed not to go anywhere else on the internet
3	all the random variables must be <1

Simulation is no of customers visiting the website and actions when visiting the website
Random variables are probabilities of different webpages. Each page is one random variable
