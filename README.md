Title: Monte Carlo Simulation for Grocery Shopping

I have always had a problem deciding what to cook for lunch/dinner. I want to use Monte Carlo Simulation that could select products to buy from the grocery to create a meal such that I do not exceed my budget and it is a meal of my choosing. 

Hypothesis:
H0: I can create an optimal list of products that fit the above two criteria. 
HA: I cannot find an optimal list of products that fit the above criteria
